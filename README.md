The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify individuals into different risk categories for heart disease based on their demographic and clinical attributes. By analyzing a dataset containing information such as age, gender, cholesterol levels,
blood pressure, and other relevant factors, we seek to build a robust model capable of providing actionable insights for healthcare professionals and individuals alike.
